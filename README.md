## Hello World :relaxed:

I am a senior portfolio manager working with [HSBC Asset Management](https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.de/de) in Dusseldorf, Germany. Besides managing fixed income and multi asset portfolios for institutional investors, I have a passion for developing and creating software. My language of choice is Python.

### My Projects

Here are some of the open-source projects that I have created and am currently working on:

- [**pyratings**](https://hsbc.github.io/pyratings) - Working with credit ratings, professionally and efficiently

    ![img](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyratings) ![imig](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyratings) ![img](https://img.shields.io/github/license/hsbc/pyratings) ![img](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/hsbc/pyratings) ![img](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hsbc/pyratings) ![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-black)

  This Python library will be useful for portfolio managers, credit analysts, as well as anybody who is working with credit ratings. It provides functions, which will be helpful in order to work with ratings in a professional and efficient way.

- [**df2img**](https://df2img.dev) (dataframe-to-image) - Save a Pandas DataFrame as image

  This small Python library greatly simplifies the process of saving a ``pd.DataFrame`` into an image file, such as ``.png`` or ``.jpg``.

## About me

I have been working with  [HSBC Asset Management](https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.de/de) since 2006. I am responsible for managing fixed income and multi asset portfolios for institutional clients.

We are using quite a bunch of quant models and algorithmic trading systems. That's the main reason why I moved into coding. I started with MATLAB back in 2015 and moved on to Python some two years later.

Please feel free to take a look at my projects and reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
